/***********************************************************************
 * This file defines year (YY) specific rules
 * 
 * 
 * The rule files contains the specifications for sequence verification.
 * They also provide details about the position and harmony, connectors, etc.
 * the free programs are relatively easy to check. The unknowns have
 * specific rules for every figure.
 * The rulesYY.js file is the main file for year YY.
 * The rulesYY-ORG.js file should contain information for ORG organization
 * (eg CIVA, IAC, glider-CIVA, etc).
 * Redirection within a file is allowed using "more=" line. Also, using
 * "more=civa program kind" allows a redirection from another organization
 * (eg IAC or BAEA) into the civa rules themselves.
 * 
 * Generally, the file contains several types of line:
 * [section]        refers to specific rules for specific sequence
 * (section)        refers to specific rules which will not show up in the
 *                  rules chooser
 * name=value       where name is usually some type of rule (such as
 *                  group-xxx), and value is a count of a regular expression,
 * catalogId value  where catalogID is an Aresti catalog number, and value
 *                  is a listing of rules applied to it
 * 
 * To write or modify these files, you'll need:
 * 1. extensive knowledge of regular expressions
 * 2. extensive knowledge of sequence design and catalog info
 * 3. complete understanding of configuration files like this
 * 4. a basic understanding of algorithms and how OpenAero processes the
 *    rules files
 * 
 * How OpenAero checks a sequence:
 *  1. create a form-A like list of the sequence. Each figure on a new line.
 *   first number on line is the base figure.
 *   next are all rolls, with 0.0.0.0(0) indicating an unused optional roll.
 *   opposite or linked rolls are x,y or x;y etc. Figure is id(k)
 * 
 *     e.g  2t4,3f line would be:   1.14.1(12) 9.1.2.2(6) 9.1.5.1(2),9.9.5.3(11)
 *     2t  would be:       1.14.1(12) 9.1.2.2(6) 0.0.0.0(0)
 * 
 *  2. the rulesYY for the sequence's date(year YY) are loaded.
 *  3. the rulesYY-rules.js file is loaded where "rules" is sequence
 *     "rules" box (CIVA, glider-CIVA, etc)
 *  4. all rules from the start of the file are read until the first [section]
 *  5. a line "[kind program]" is searched in the file and if found, that
 *     section is read
 *  6. a "more=section" line, if read, makes the program read the "more"
 *     section.
 *  7. all "group-xxx" rules have a list of (figure: count) associated
 *     with them, and a total count.
 *  8. [removed]
 *  9. OpenAero goes over every complete full figure (line from 1 above)
 *     and in it, every individual catalog number:
 *     a. every Group-xxx rule (capital G) is matched against the full
 *        figure(line), and if so, counted
 *     b. every group-xxx rule (lowercase g) is matched against every
 *        catalog number, and if so, counted
 *     c. group-k is special, and counts the total k instead of the
 *        number of figures
 *     d. the list of figure:count (item 8) is also counted, (ignored
 *        for connectors)
 *     e. if the catalog id is not matched in "allow=" nor in the list
 *        of figures (lines without "=" eg 7.2.1-2) an alert occurs
 *        "figure xxx not allowed"
 *     f. for the base figure (first figure on every line), the base
 *        rules are checked, e.g. the rule "1.2.1-4 NOU" will check the
 *        NOU rule for the figure 1.2.1 line
 *     g. for the base figure, if a "allow-defrules=" rule exists, it is
 *        also checked (default rules for every base figure)
 *     h. for each line, if a group-xxx-minperfig or group-xxx-maxperfig
 *        rule exists, it is checked with the line count
 *     i. for every group so counted, a total for the sequence is added.
 * 10. base rules are checked (item 9f and 9g above) as follows:
 *     a. the list of base rules are separated by ";"
 *     b. for a rule "abc" there must be a "rule-abc=xxx:yyy" line
 *     c. the "xxx" is a conversion rule, a reg-ex substitute applied to
 *        the figure line, listed as "conv-xxx="
 *     d. the conversion rule is applied
 *     e. if "yyy" "<nn"  where nn is a number, then the conversion's
 *        result numbers are summed per element and must be below nn.
 *     f. otherwise, "yyy" is a regex. if the convered result matches
 *        "yyy" an alert is reported
 * 11. conversion rules "conv-xxx=" are used to check for individual
 *     figure limitations, mostly to limit rolls on unknown figures
 *     a. the conversion regex is applied for each catalog id on the line
 *     b. the conversion regex is a ";" separated list of regex=replace,
 *     c. if the regex is matched, the whole catalog info is replaced by
 *        the replace string.
 *     d. if the replace contains $1, $2 or $3 itself, this is replaced
 *        by the first or 2nd or 3rd () match of the regex
 * 12. after all the full figures been counted for, OpenAero goes through
 *     every group (figure:count) to check for repetitions
 *     a. any specific figure:count with count bigger than group-repeat
 *        is reported
 *     b. the total repeats of figure:count within a group is matched
 *        against group-totrepeat and reported.
 *        For example, you can have a rule for snaps ("group-snap=^9\.9")
 *        the group-repeat=3 would allow any specific snap to be repeated
 *        three times. The group-totrepeat=4 would allow only 4
 *        repetitions in total (ie 4 snaps each had 2 repetitions, or
 *        2 snaps with 3 repeats)
 *     c. and group-min and group-max are checked and reported
 * 13. any seqcheck-xxx rule is matched agains the OpenAero
 *     representation of the sequence (can be used to test entry etc)
 * 
 * Note that because group-k is special, and group-base is simply a
 * count of base figures, the basic test, e.g. for
 * unlimited unknown:
 * group-k=^   # group k is special, total the K-factor per fig/seq
 * group-basefig=^[1-8]
 * basefig-max=9
 * k-max=420
 * 
 * is a result of the application of the above rules! There are no
 * built-in rules except the above.
 * 
 * A detailed listing of all special conventions:
 * 
 * Group-x=regex  define a group for a full figure (match full line)
 * group-x=regex  define a group for catalog id (match rolls and base figs)
 * x-min          specify minimum value for group for the whole sequence
 * x-max          specify maximum -"-
 * x-repeat       specify maximum repeation of identical items that have
 *                matched the group
 * x-minperfig    specify a min that applies per figure
 * x-maxperfig    specify a max that applies per figure
 * group-k        is special, count is the K factor total
 * x-name         specify group name for x, for displaying errors
 * x-name_xx      the same, but for language xx
 * x-y-rule       the catalog or sporting code rule upon which the error
 *                of test y is based, for example:
 *                k-maxperfig-rule=Sporting Code Section 6 Part I, 4.3.4.1
 * 
 * allow=regex    specify a regex to match catalog ids to allow them to be used
 * 1.2.4  A;B ..  explictly allow BASE figure id. Rules A B etc are checked
 * conv-x=a=b;c=d... specify a regex sub a:b c:d etc to apply to rolls
 *                   cat# when rule is explictly specified on base fig
 * rule-A=x:regex when A is attacehd to allow figure: apply conv-x to
 *                rolls catalog info, then regex must match.
 * why-A          details of why rule has failed to apply for specific figure
 * why_xx-A       the same, but for language xx
 * 
 * seqcheck-x=    is a complete regex that must match the OpenAero sequence
 *                itself. can be used to ensure eg cross box entry...
 * more=section   continue reading rules from given section
 * 
 * for example, using "group-snap=^9\.9" defines the group of inside snaps.
 * you can use "snap-max=4" to specify a maximum of 4 snaps per sequence,
 * snap-maxperfig=1 to allow at most one snap per figure,
 * and "snap-repeat=2" to specify any snap element can be repeated at most twice.
 * 
 * a [section] describes a specific sequence for checking.
 * [iac unlimited free] first element is rules type, 2nd sequence type 3rd is program
 * each section describes general rules using grouping, and specific rules per
 * allowed figure. A list of figures is provided which are allowed explicitly,
 * plus an "allow=" can be used to specify which figures to allow by regex
 * using a regular expression.
 * 
 * example
 * conv-foconv= ^9\.1=f ; ^9\.[^1]=o
 * rule-no2ndsnap=foconv: [fo],o|[fo,]+ [fo],o
 * 
 * no2ndsnap-why=snap may not be the 2nd element on the first or 2nd lines
 * convert to just 'f' or 'o' instead of the rolling elements before rules are applied.
 * e.g  2t4,3f the line is:  1.14.1 9.1.2.2 9.1.5.1,9.9.5.3  converted to: 1.14.1 f f,o
 * for conversion, a , is used for opposite and a ; for same-direction rolls.
 * For rule match, match always anchored ^ at the start of the converted seq
 * if we had specificed:
 * 1.14.1 no2ndsnap
 * Then for 1.14.1 the 'foconv' conversion would first be applied,
 * then apply rule no2ndsnap to "f f,o" so the rule
 * would be true and the program will disallow the figure.
 * 
 * allow-defrules=
 *   list of default rules which are applied to ALL figures
 * additionals=XX/YY
 *   allowed number and total K of additionals
 * unknown-letters=ABCDEFGHIJ
 *   allowed letters for Free Unknown figures
 * sf=r1:f1;r2:f2;r3:f3;...
 *   Super Families for the programme. Each rX is a regex. A match will
 *   result in SF fX being assigned. Only the FIRST match is applied so
 *   the order matters!
 * floating-point=
 *   number of floating point that can be reduced from program if needed.
 *   FP is included in k-max.
 * demo=
 *   add sequence string to Demo menu
 * reference=
 *   fill reference sequence with supplied sequence string
